## What is Stan?

[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) takes the difficult parts out of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and statistical computation.

Essentially it's an interface to a bunch of linear algebra written in C++ and some probability density functions.

Stan lets us focus on writing model code that approximately resembles how we write Bayesian models with pen and paper.


```{r, fig.width=2, fig.height=2, fig.align='right'}

## What is RStan?

RStan is just a wrapper around Stan that lets us access Stan from R.

We don't need to use RStan, instead we could use:

- Python, PyStan.
- Shell, CMDStan.
- MATLAB, MatlabStan.
- Julia, Stan.jl.
- Stata, StataStan (if you __really__ want to).

However, RStan is the most mature option with the largest community and a rich ecosystem of supporting packages ([rstanarm](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/), [brms](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/brms), [tidybayes](http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/)...).

## Why Stan?

- Stan is more flexible than alternative Bayesian offerings such as JAGS and BUGS.
- Stan's MCMC methods use __Hamiltonian Monte Carlo__ rather than Gibbs sampling or Metropolis-Hastings.
    - This is sort of a big deal.
- Models we couldn't dream of fitting with Gibbs or MH are now (relatively) easy to fit.

## Our First Model

The "hello world!" of Bayesian modelling in Stan is the [eight schools experiment](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) (Rubin 1981, Gelman et al 2003).

We want to find the effect of specialist coaching on SAT test scores. The programme was implemented in parallel across 8 different schools:


```{r, results = "asis"}
library(dplyr)
school_data <- list(J = 8, 
                    y = c(28,  8, -3,  7, -1,  1, 18, 12),
                    sigma = c(15, 10, 16, 11,  9, 11, 10, 18))
school_data %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(school = row_number()) %>% 
  select(-J) %>% 
  t() %>% 
  kable()
```


## The Model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_j & \sim \text{Normal}(\theta_j, \sigma_j), \  j = 1,...,8 \\
\theta_j &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu, \tau), \ j = 1,...,8 \\
 \sigma_j  & \  \text{known.}
\end{aligned}
$$

## data

We create a `.stan` file named `eight_school.stan` (you can find it under the `stan/` folder in the repo).

Each Stan file contains a `data` modelling block:
```{stan, echo = TRUE,  eval = FALSE, output.var = "data_block"}
data {
  int<lower=0> J; // N schools
  real y[J]; // treatment indexed by J
  real<lower=0> sigma[J]; // s.e. indexed by J
}
```



## parameters

The parameters model block is pretty simple too:

```{stan, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, output.var = "param_block"}

parameters {
  real mu;
  real<lower=0> tau;
  real theta[J];
}


```


## model

Here we specify the likelihood and our priors:

```{stan, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, output.var="model_block"}

model {
  // Our "population" priors
  mu ~ normal(0, 5); // location
  tau ~ cauchy(0, 5); // scale
  
  // The "lower rung" of the hierarchy ladder
  theta ~ normal(mu, tau); 
  
  // Our likelihood:
  y ~ normal(theta, sigma); 
}


```

## Fitting the Model

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(rstan)
options(mc.cores = 4) # parallel::detectCores() is most people's goto
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) # Saves time on model re-compilation

# Compile the model
eight_school_centred_stan <- stan_model(file = "stan/eight_school_centred.stan")
# Fit the model
model_draws <- sampling(eight_school_centred_stan,
                        data = school_data)
```
