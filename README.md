# An Introduction to Bayesian Modelling in RStan

This repo contains the scripts, data and compiled Stan code to accompany the presentation. Follow along with binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EdJeeOnGitHub/rstan-example/master) or install RStan using instructions found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started). When using binder navigate to the "new" button at the top right and select "RStudio Session" to run RStudio.

The slides for the first part of the talk can be found in the `slides/` folder, the accompanying R script is called `introduction to stan.R`.

The latter part of the presentation uses `regression in stan.R`.
